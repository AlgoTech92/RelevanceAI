Installation
===============

The only prerequisite for installing Relevance AI is Python3 itself. 
If you donâ€™t have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, 
we recommend you use the PyPi Distribution.

.. code-block::

    pip install -U RelevanceAI

To install the development version with all the latest features, we recommend using:

.. code-block::

    pip install -U RelevanceAI-dev
